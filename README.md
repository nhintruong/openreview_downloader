# OpenReview Paper Downloader

Simple download, listing, and search of oral, spotlight, accepted, or rejected papers from OpenReview into tidy folders by decision.

Despite the name, this works for **any** OpenReview-hosted conference (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, etc.).

## Installation

```bash
pip install openreview_downloader
```

## Usage

The CLI saves PDFs into `downloads/<venue>/<decision>/` with sanitized filenames.

**Available decisions:**
- `oral` – Oral presentations
- `spotlight` – Spotlight presentations
- `accepted` – All accepted papers
- `rejected` – Rejected papers
- `all` – Accepted and rejected papers

### Basic examples (NeurIPS)

Download all NeurIPS oral papers:

```bash
ordl oral --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

Download Output:

```
downloads
└── neurips2025
    └── oral
        ├── 27970_Deep_Compositional_Phase_Diffusion.pdf
        ...
        └── 28928_Generalized_Linear_Mode_Connectivity.pdf
```


Download all NeurIPS oral and spotlight papers:

```bash
ordl oral,spotlight --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

Download all accepted NeurIPS papers (any presentation type):

```bash
ordl accepted --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

See decision counts without downloading:

```bash
ordl --info --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

Example output:

```

```

### List and preview papers

List all accepted papers without downloading:

```bash
ordl accepted --list --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

List accepted and rejected papers:

```bash
ordl all --list --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

Show only the first 3 accepted papers:

```bash
ordl accepted --list --head 3 --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

Example output:

```

29260 [accepted] REVE: A Foundation Model for EEG - Adapting to Any Setup with Large-Scale Pretraining on 25,000 Subjects

```

If you omit `DECISIONS` while listing or searching, the CLI defaults to accepted papers and exits without downloading:

```bash
ordl --head 20 --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

### Search, grep, and regex workflows

Search over title, authors, abstract, keywords, decision, venue, id, paper number, and (where available) dataset and code URLs. `--search` and `--grep` are aliases; matching is case-insensitive by default.

Preview accepted papers matching a text query:

```bash
ordl accepted --list --search diffusion --head 2 --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

Example output:

```

```

Preview regex matches and show snippets plus counts:

```bash
ordl accepted --list --regex 'diffusion|transformer' --head 2 --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

Download the same selection by rerunning the same query without `--list`:

```bash
ordl accepted --search diffusion --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

Download only the first 10 matches:

```bash
ordl accepted --search diffusion --head 10 --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

Require multiple terms or patterns by repeating the flags:

```bash
ordl accepted --list --grep diffusion --grep protein --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

For scripts, agents, and crawlbots, use JSON Lines output while listing:

```bash
ordl accepted --list --search diffusion --head 2 --format jsonl --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

The first JSON line is a summary with the number of matched and shown papers; each following line is one paper record with stable fields such as `id`, `number`, `decision`, `title`, `authors`, `pdf_path`, `match_count`, and `matches`. Records also include `dataset_url`, `code_url`, and `croissant_file`; these are populated for the Datasets and Benchmarks Track (see below) and are empty strings for venues that don't provide them.

JSONL keeps progress logs on stderr so stdout can be piped directly into tools:

```json
{"decisions": ["accepted"], "head": 2, "matched_papers": 710, "shown_papers": 2, "type": "summary", "venue_id": "NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference"}
{"authors": "Jiyao Zhang, Zhiyuan Ma, Tianhao Wu, Zeyuan Chen, Hao Dong", "decision": "accepted", "id": "CB8jwNE2vV", "match_count": 1, "matches": [{"count": 1, "field": "abstract", "query": "diffusion", "snippet": "... high-dimensional representation, we introduce an occupancy-[diffusion] model with voxel-level conditional guidance and force closu..."}], "number": 29119, "pdf_path": "downloads/neurips2025/accepted/29119_CADGrasp_Learning_Contact_and_Collision_Aware_General_Dexterous_Grasping_in_Cluttered_Scenes.pdf", "title": "CADGrasp: Learning Contact and Collision Aware General Dexterous Grasping in Cluttered Scenes", "type": "paper", "venue": "NeurIPS 2025 poster", "venueid": "NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference"}
```

### Other Conferences (ICLR, ICML, etc.)

Just change the `--venue-id` to the appropriate OpenReview handle.

**ICLR 2025 orals only:**

```bash
ordl oral --venue-id ICLR.cc/2025/Conference
```

**ICLR 2025 accepted papers (all formats):**

```bash
ordl accepted --venue-id ICLR.cc/2025/Conference
```

**ICML 2025 oral + spotlight:**

```bash
ordl oral,spotlight --venue-id ICML.cc/2025/Conference
```

You can use any other OpenReview venue ID in the same way.

### Datasets and Benchmarks Track

NeurIPS runs a separate Datasets and Benchmarks Track with its own venue id. It works exactly like the main Conference, just with a different `--venue-id`:

```bash
ordl accepted --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Datasets_and_Benchmarks_Track
```

Because the track is distinct from the main Conference, its papers are saved to their own folder so the two never collide:

```
downloads/
├── neurips2025/                                # main Conference
└── neurips2025_datasets_and_benchmarks_track/  # Datasets and Benchmarks Track
```

To grab both tracks, run the command twice with each venue id.

Datasets and Benchmarks papers carry extra metadata that the CLI extracts automatically:

- `dataset_url` – link to the dataset (often a Hugging Face, Kaggle, or GitHub URL)
- `code_url` – link to the accompanying code repository
- `croissant_file` – reference to the attached [Croissant](https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant) metadata file

`dataset_url` and `code_url` are searchable, so you can filter the track by them. For example, list every paper whose dataset is hosted on Hugging Face:

```bash
ordl accepted --list --search huggingface --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Datasets_and_Benchmarks_Track
```

In text output these appear as `dataset:` and `code:` lines under each paper; in `--format jsonl` they are fields on every record (empty strings for venues that don't provide them).

### Metadata manifest

When downloading (i.e. not `--list`), the CLI also writes a `metadata.jsonl` manifest into the output directory, for example `downloads/neurips2025_datasets_and_benchmarks_track/metadata.jsonl`. It contains one JSON record per selected paper — the same schema as `--list --format jsonl` — including the `dataset_url`, `code_url`, and `croissant_file` fields. This persists the metadata (and dataset links) alongside the PDFs instead of only printing it.

The manifest covers the whole current selection, including papers that were already present and skipped, and is rewritten on each run to reflect that run's selection (so narrowing with `--head` or a search produces a manifest for just those papers).


### CLI Options

- **`DECISIONS`** (positional) – Comma-separated list of decisions to select (`oral`, `spotlight`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `all`)
- **`--venue-id`** – OpenReview venue ID (default: `NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference` or env `VENUE_ID`)
- **`--out-dir`** – Custom output directory (default: `downloads/<venue>/`)
- **`--no-skip-existing`** – Re-download even if the PDF is already present
- **`--info`** – Print decision counts for the venue and exit
- **`--list`** – List selected papers and exit without downloading
- **`--head N`** – Limit the selection to the first `N` papers; useful for previews or small downloads
- **`--search TEXT` / `--grep TEXT`** – Text search across paper metadata; repeat to require multiple terms
- **`--regex PATTERN`** – Regex search across paper metadata; repeat to require multiple patterns
- **`--case-sensitive`** – Make search and regex matching case-sensitive
- **`--format text|jsonl`** – Output format for `--list`; `jsonl` is convenient for automation
